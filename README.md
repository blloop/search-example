# Simple Search

> A search interface for academic publications that utilizes the CrossRef public API

## About this project

What this app does: 
* Renders a search interface that accepts a search query term
* Produces search results in the form of source information (i.e. link, references, etc.)
* Filters and sorts results as requested through the interface

This project was originally created as part of a challenge. Nonetheless, working through this project allowed me to practice my front-end development skills and integration of APIs. 

### Development

* Built with: React.js
* Deployed with: GitHub Pages
